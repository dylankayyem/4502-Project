## Description of the project:

	Our project aims to analyze the "World Energy Consumption" dataset to uncover key insights into the dynamic landscape of global energy consumption and production. We will address five specific questions: 
	 ✓ Renewable Energy Adoption Trends: We will investigate how the annual changes in electricity generation from wind and solar sources have evolved over time, shedding light on countries at the forefront of renewable energy adoption. 
	 ✓ Fossil Fuel Dependency and Electricity Generation: Our analysis will focus on the annual changes in electricity generation from fossil fuels, allowing us to identify regions experiencing a notable shift away from fossil fuel-based electricity production. 
	 ✓ Per Capita Energy Consumption and Economic Growth: By examining the correlation between a country's per capita energy consumption and GDP, we aim to identify nations achieving remarkable economic growth while maintaining low energy intensity. 
	 ✓ Carbon Intensity of Electricity Production: We will explore the changing global trends in carbon intensity of electricity production, aiming to pinpoint countries leading in clean energy generation and those facing environmental challenges. 
	 ✓ Hydropower and Wind Energy Growth: Our analysis will track the annual changes in electricity generation from hydropower and wind energy sources, revealing countries that exhibit significant growth in these vital renewable energy sectors. Through data analysis and visualization, we will provide valuable insights into the ongoing energy transition, environmental sustainability, and the economic implications of energy consumption patterns worldwide.
